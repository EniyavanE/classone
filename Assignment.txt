1)HTTP 
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to request and send information between the client and the server.
Differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2:
	-->Http2 is faster and more efficient than http1.1
	-->Http2 prioritize the content which one should load first where as http1.1 doesn't prioritize.
	-->http2 sends all the content in a single tcp connection called multiplexing but http1.1 sends content one by one.
	-->http2 has advanced compression called HPACK it compress the http message and sends it fast on the otherhand http1.1 doesn't compress the http message. 






2)Objects and its internal representatives
	-->Its a non-primitive datatype.
        -->Object contains one or more data with any combination of primitive datatypes.
        -->It is in unordered form.It stores data in key value pair.
        -->Obejcts can be created using different methods
            i)Object literals
              eg.) let obj1={
                   name:"Eniyavan",
                   age:25,
                   gender:"Male"}
            ii)Using keyword new
               eg.) var obj2 = new Object();
                    obj2.name="Eniyavan";
                    obj2.age=25;
                    obj2.gender="Male";
        -->Methods of accessing the data
             console.log(obj1.name);
             console.log([obj1["name"]);
           If we accessed the unassigned property name we can undefined.
       -->To add data in object
           let obj1={
                   name:"Eniyavan",
                   age:25,
                   gender:"Male"}

           i)Dot Notation:
                 obj1.email="eniyavan133@gmail.com"
            ii)sqaure bracket notation:
                 obj1["contact"]=9150831020.
